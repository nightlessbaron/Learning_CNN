# Numpy-CNN
A numpy-only implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network, from the ground up.


## Purpose

To gain a quality understanding of convolutional neural networks and what makes them peform so well, I constructed one from scratch with NumPy. This CNN is in no way intended to replace popular DL frameworks such as Tensorflow or Torch, it is instead meant to serve as an instructional tool.
